abstract = {Abstract Subduction is a key component of Earth's long-term sulfur cycle; however, the mechanisms that drive sulfur from subducting slabs remain elusive. Isotopes are a sensitive indicator of the speciation of sulfur in fluids, sulfide dissolution-precipitation reactions, and inferring fluid sources. To investigate these processes, we report δ34S values determined by secondary ion mass spectroscopy in sulfides from a global suite of exhumed high-pressure rocks. Sulfides are classified into two petrogenetic groups: (1) metamorphic, which represent closed-system (re)crystallization from protolith-inherited sulfur, and (2) metasomatic, which formed during open system processes, such as an influx of oxidized sulfur. The δ34S values for metamorphic sulfides tend to reflect their precursor compositions: −4.3 ‰ to +13.5 ‰ for metabasic rocks, and −32.4 ‰ to −11.0 ‰ for metasediments. Metasomatic sulfides exhibit a range of δ34S from −21.7 ‰ to +13.9 ‰. We suggest that sluggish sulfur self-diffusion prevents isotopic fractionation during sulfide breakdown and that slab fluids inherit the isotopic composition of their source. We estimate a composition of −11 ‰ to +8 ‰ for slab fluids, a significantly smaller range than observed for metasomatic sulfides. Large fractionations during metasomatic sulfide precipitation from sulfate-bearing fluids, and an evolving fluid composition during reactive transport may account for the entire ~36 ‰ range of metasomatic sulfide compositions. Thus, we suggest that sulfates are likely the dominant sulfur species in slab-derived fluids.},

@article{Brady1983,
	abstract = {{The rates of homogenization of coherent exsolution lamellae in cryptoperthites have been used to evaluate K-Na interdiffusion in alkali feldspars. An ``average'' interdiffusion coefficient (D) is between 2 and 4 x 10-17 cm2/sec for a synthetic cryptoperthite at 600$\,^{\circ}$C in the composition range Or23-Or53, and between 6 and 12 x 10-16 cm2/sec for a natural cryptoperthite at 650$\,^{\circ}$C in the composition range Or0-Or85. These values are for diffusion normal to (801) at 1 atmosphere pressure. K-Na interdiffusion coefficients calculated from published K and Na self-diffusion coefficients and thermochemical solution data for alkali feldspars depend strongly on composition. The minimum D's calculated are similar to the ``average'' D's determined from the homogenization experiments. Finite-difiference models of the homogenization experiments using the calculated, composition-dependent interdiffusion coefficients are in good agreement with our experimental results. Homogenization experiments appear to be successful in determining average interdiffusion coefficients which are consistent with diffusion data obtained using other techniques. The method is especially useful for determining D's in the range of 10-16 to 10-19 cm2/sec.}},

Concentration profiles were measured using an electron microprobe and results were obtained for inter-diffusion in four crystallographic directions at 1000$\,^{\circ}$C. Inter-diffusion coefficients (D) were calculated as a function of composition from Or10 to Or80. Alkali inter-diffusion is about 10 times faster normal to (001) than normal to (010), and the rate is intermediate parallel to [100] and [011]. A trace amount of water appears to have no influence on the inter-diffusion rate, and within experimental error there is no difference in D between 5 and 15 kbar. There is agreement between the D values determined experimentally and those calculated from published self-diffusion coefficients. The nonideality of the alkali feldspar binary at 1000$\,^{\circ}$C has a significant effect on D, and this effect becomes increasingly important at lower temperature.}},

	abstract = {Tracer diffusion kinetics at 1 atm pressure under `dry' conditions using 6Li, 41K, and 87Rb in four plagioclase feldspars have been determined. Diffusion profiles were measured using an ion microprobe (SIMS). The Arrhenius parameters and $\pm$ 2σ uncertainties for Li, K, and Rb, respectively, in albite, are: pre-exponential factor (log Do) = - 3.8 $\pm$ 1.0; −3.4 $\pm$ 1.4; and −5.8 $\pm$ 3.8 (in m2/s) and activation energies = 146 $\pm$ 14; 296 $\pm$ 30; and 283 $\pm$ 85 kJ/mol. The diffusion rate of K in albite at 700$\,^{\circ}$C and 100 MPa water pressure equals that at 1 atm `dry', suggesting that diffusion of K is not dependent on water fugacity between ∼ 0.004 and 100 MPa. The K diffusion rate depends on plagioclase anorthite content and is approximately 20 times slower in labradorite than albite. Li diffusion rates in albite and anorthite are identical. A linear relation between log D for the alkalis measured and their ionic radius squared, permits an estimate of Cs diffusion kinetics. Diffusion rates are isotropic or nearly so in albite.},

@article{Cruz-Uribe:2021aa,
	abstract = {Here we present major element, trace element, and oxygen isotope data for garnet from an amphibolitized eclogite block from Ring Mountain, Franciscan Complex, California, USA. Garnetite veins 1--5 cm thick are laterally continuous up to 10 m within an Mg-rich blackwall zone of the eclogite block. Complex major and trace element zoning patterns reveal multiple stages of garnet growth in both the matrix and garnetite veins. Similarities in major and trace element zoning between matrix and vein garnet suggest that crystallization of the garnetite veins began toward the end of matrix garnet core growth, and continued throughout the garnet growth history of the rock. Oscillatory zoning in rare-earth elements suggests garnet growth in pulses, with matrix-diffusion-limited growth in between pulses. Oxygen isotope analyses of matrix and vein garnet have a range in δ18O values of 5.3--11.1 ‰. Differences in δ18O values of up to \~{} 4 ‰between garnet core and rim are observed in both the matrix and vein; garnet cores range from 9.8 to 11.1 ‰(median 10.4‰), garnet mantles range from 8.3 to 10.0 ‰(median 9.7 ‰), and garnet rims range from 5.8 to 7.8 ‰(median 6.7 ‰). Late-stage vein crystallization appears as a garnet ``cement''that fills in a network of small (typically 5--50 µm) garnet cores, and likely crystallized from an amorphous phase. The low δ18O values of this latest stage of garnet growth are consistent with interaction with serpentinites, and likely represent the physical incorporation of the eclogite block into the serpentinite matrix m{\'e}lange.},

	abstract = {A survey, carried out using transmission electron microscopy, of exsolution-derived microstructures developed in titanomagnetites is presented. Microstructures, probably produced by spinodal decomposition, consist of a three-dimensional lamellar framework of ulvospinel, separating magnetite-enriched blocks. In coarser textures the magnetite-enriched regions have a plate morphology, and the ulvospinel-enriched lamellae develop secondary exsolution textures. The implications of exsolution for the magnetic properties of titanomagnetites are discussed. The coarsening of exsolution textures will cause the blocking temperature of the magnetite-enriched regions to increase with time. The development of magnetite-enriched plates may alter the magnetic properties of the titanomagnetite, as may the stress associated with some of the small scale, coherent microstructures.},

@article{10.2138/am.2009.3002,
	abstract = {{Spinel single crystals of 19 compositions along the magnetite-ulv{\"o}spinel join were synthesized by use of a flux-growth method. To obtain quantitative site populations, the crystals were analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, electron-microprobe techniques, and M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy. All results were processed by using an optimization model.The unit-cell parameter, oxygen fractional coordinate, and tetrahedral bond length increase with increasing ulv{\"o}spinel component, whereas the octahedral bond length decreases marginally. These changes result in sigmoidal crystal-chemical relationships consistent with cation substitutions in fully occupied sites. As a first approximation, the Akimoto model T(Fe1−X3+FeX2+)M(Fe2+Fe1−X3+TiX)O4 describes the cation substitutions. Deviations from this model can be explained by an electron exchange reaction TFe2+ + MFe3+ = TFe3+ + MFe2+, which causes MFe2+ ≠ 1 and TFe2+/Ti ≠ 1. The resultant S-shaped trends may be related to a directional change in the electron exchange reaction at Ti ≈ 0.7 apfu. In general, variations in structural parameters over the whole compositional range can be split into two contributions: (1) a linear variation due to the TFe3+ + MFe3+ = TFe2+ + MTi4+ chemical substitution and (2) non-linear variations caused by the internal electron exchange reaction.In accordance with bond-valence theory, strained bonds ascribable to steric effects characterize the structure of magnetite-ulv{\"o}spinel crystals. To relax the bonds and thereby minimize the internal strain under retained spinel space group symmetry, the electron exchange reaction occurs.}},

	abstract = {{The single-crystal elastic moduli of minerals and related materials with cubic symmetry have been collected and evaluated. The compiled data set covers measurements made over an approximately 70 year period and consists of 206 compositions. More than 80\\% of the database is comprised of silicates, oxides, and halides, and approximately 90\\% of the entries correspond to one of six crystal structures (garnet, rocksalt, spinel, perovskite, sphalerite, and fluorite). Primary data recorded are the composition of each material, its crystal structure, density, and the three independent nonzero adiabatic elastic moduli (C11, C12, and C44). From these, a variety of additional elastic and acoustic properties are calculated and compiled, including polycrystalline aggregate elastic properties, sound velocities, and anisotropy factors. The database is used to evaluate trends in cubic mineral elasticity through consideration of normalized elastic moduli (Blackman diagrams) and the Cauchy pressure. The elastic anisotropy and auxetic behavior of these materials are also examined. Compilations of single-crystal elastic moduli provide a useful tool for investigation structure-property relationships of minerals.}},

abstract = {Laboratory analysis of samples returned from an asteroid establishes a direct link between asteroids and meteorites and provides clues to the complex history of the asteroid and its surface. Regolith particles on the asteroid Itokawa were recovered by the Hayabusa mission. Their three-dimensional (3D) structure and other properties, revealed by x-ray microtomography, provide information on regolith formation. Modal abundances of minerals, bulk density (3.4 grams per cubic centimeter), and the 3D textures indicate that the particles represent a mixture of equilibrated and less-equilibrated LL chondrite materials. Evidence for melting was not seen on any of the particles. Some particles have rounded edges. Overall, the particles’ size and shape are different from those seen in particles from the lunar regolith. These features suggest that meteoroid impacts on the asteroid surface primarily form much of the regolith particle, and that seismic-induced grain motion in the smooth terrain abrades them over time.}}
